<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cameron Brady and I am a 22 year old web developer. I decided on this career path because I enjoy creating projects and love a good challenge. There is nothing more satisfying than creating something from scratch and seeing the final product after all the hard work you put in.
</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, fishing, camping, and of course writing and coding. I have always been an outdoors person which may seem odd since I chose a career path that takes place at a desk but I beleive it provides a nice balance which is extremely important in life. My main goal in life is to always be happy and bring joy to those around me.</p>
