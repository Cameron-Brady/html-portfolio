<h1>Cameron's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts </h3>
<p>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts brought a new twist to the series as it introduced a new setting and totally different character styles.</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
<p>GOTG Vol. 3 focused more on the backstory of the characters which made it feel more personal than the other movies in the series.</p>

<h3>The Longest Yard</h3>
<p>The Longest Yard brought together football and comedy in a way that no other movie has in my opinion.</p>
